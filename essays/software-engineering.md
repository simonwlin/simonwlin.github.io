## Interests in Software Engineering

Coming into a software engineering class, I do not know what anything is or what anything does. However, I do have some experience with programming languages like Java, C/C++, and Python which I hope will be helpful for this class. I am particularly interested in learning more about the programming language used in software engineering which I believe are HTML and Javascript. Furthermore, I am open to learning about anything so that I can expand my skills and gain more knowledge about software engineering. 

## Skills and Experiences hope to develop

In my software engineering journey, I aim to develop skills and gain experience that will prepare me for anything I do in software engineering. I plan to strengthen my understanding of HTML, and Javascript through practicing the WODS we do, the group activities we do in class, and practicing on my own time. Although I have used GitHub for my previous classes, I want to get more used to using GitHub because it seems like a useful skill to know how to do things on GitHub and what their purpose is. By the end of this class, I want to be able to use these skills and valuable experiences to contribute to software engineering projects. 

## Final Thoughts

Although I currently do not know anything about software engineering, I believe that learning about software engineering will be incredibly helpful and valuable. Having a good understanding of software engineering will definitely help with enhancing skills. I am excited to learn more about software engineering and apply what I have learned in this course to software engineering projects.
