Third, create a technical essay (approximately 3-4 paragraphs) that discusses your interests in software engineering and what kinds of skills and experiences you hope to develop in the future. I need a better title

## Interests in Software Engineering

In my software engineering journey, I aim to develop skills and gain experience that will prepare me for anything I do in software engineering. I plan to strengthen my understanding of HTML, and Javascript through practicing the WODS we do, the group activities we do in class, and practicing on my own time. Additionally, I want to get more used to using GitHub because it seems like a useful skill to know how to do things on GitHub and what their purpose is. By the end of this class, I want to be able to use these skills and valuable experiences to contribute to software engineering projects. 

## Skills and Experiences hope to develop

In software engineering, I hope I get better at coding in HTML and JavaScript because I might need it in my future career and I want to be prepared. To achieve this, I should practice the WODS, go to class, and code at least 10 hours a week. Furthermore, I want to do more group activities so that I can learn more about coding from my teammates, that way I can enhance my coding skills. 

## Final Thoughts

Although I currently do not know anything about software engineering, I believe that learning about software engineering will be incredibly helpful and valuable. Having a good understanding of software engineering will definitely help with enhancing skills. I am excited to learn more about software engineering and apply what I have learned in this course to software engineering projects.
