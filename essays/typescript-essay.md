Third, create a technical essay (approximately 3-4 paragraphs) that discusses your interests in software engineering and what kinds of skills and experiences you hope to develop in the future. I need a better title

## Interests in Software Engineering

Coming into a software engineering class, I do not know what anything is or what anything does. However, I do have some experience with programming languages like Java, C/C++, and Python which I hope will be helpful for this class. I am particularly interested in learning more about the programming language used in software engineering which I believe are HTML and Javascript. Furthermore, I am open to learning about anything so that I can expand my skills and gain more knowledge about software engineering. 

## Skills and Experiences hope to develop

In software engineering, I hope I get better at coding in HTML and JavaScript because I might need it in my future career and I want to be prepared. To achieve this, I should practice the WODS, go to class, and code at least 10 hours a week. Furthermore, I want to do more group activities so that I can learn more about coding from my teammates, that way I can enhance my coding skills. 

## Final Thoughts

As a result, I want to get better at coding.
