# Method of Estimation
When working on my project tasks, I made my effort estimates based on how hard I think the task may be. For example, if my task were to create an HTML page, I estimate it to be an hour or so because we have done something similar before in class. However, if the task was to put data into the database, it may take longer to do since I did not have much practice with inputting data into the database. For tracking my estimated time, I set a timer on my phone for 20 minutes and would add more time if I was not done completing my task. I believe that my tracking was inaccurate because sometimes when my timer went off, I would doomscroll, causing my time to be longer than it should be. Finally, I believe tracking these took almost no time since I had to just check my timer once in a while. 

# Benefits of Effort Estimation and Actual Effort Time
Even though my estimates were always off, I still believe there are benefits to making an effort at estimation. For me, effort estimation has benefited me by allowing me to see my progress, be organized, and set expectations. Also, it helped me understand where I needed to improve and how I can spend more time more wisely in the future. Additionally, by tracking my actual time it took me to complete a task, it allowed me to compare my actual vs. my estimated time. By letting me compare my estimated vs. my actual time, I got to improve my future estimates 

# Conclusion
Despite the inaccuracies in my effort estimate, the process of estimating and tracking time proved valuable. Making initial guesses helped me stay organized, set realistic expectations, and identify areas where I need improvement. Comparing my estimated and actual time revealed patterns in my workflow, allowing me to adjust future predictions and manage my time more effectively. Ultimately, even rough estimations are better than none at all.
