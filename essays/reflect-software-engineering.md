# The Experience in ICS 314
Now that I am almost done with ICS 314, I have learned that this class is not only about web development, but also about acquiring experience with fundamental software engineering concepts. While we used web technologies such as Node.js and React, the concepts we learned, such as design patterns and coding standards, can be used in the future. 

# Concepts Learned
Design Patterns are like solutions that can be reused for other issues that software engineers come across. In this course, I used similar design patterns when doing the in-class WODs since I’ve done the practice WODs, I just reused some of the code that I had already written. This allowed me to save time, reduce errors, and since I already wrote the code beforehand, I understand what my code does. Although I used design patterns in this course, I can see myself using them in my other projects or classes because using design patterns saves time, makes code easier to modify, organize, and communicate with other developers. 

Coding standards are rules to follow when you code because these rules help make the code look more organized, neat, and readable to others. For example, many people who code usually have proper indentation and spacing within their code. This is to help with making the code look more organized, clean, and make it easier when it comes to debugging. In this course, we used ESLint to practice coding standards. ESLint is a code analysis tool for JavaScript and TypeScript. Using ESLint helped me follow coding standards by identifying and fixing problems in my code. Ultimately, ESLint is a helpful tool if you want to get better at following coding standards. Beyond web application development, I can see myself applying coding standards in creating a mobile app, creating a game, or in anything data science or AI related. 

# Final Thoughts
ICS 314 has taught me that software engineering is not just writing code; it is about solving problems systematically. Design patterns and coding standards can be used anywhere, whether I’m developing a website or creating a game. Moving forward, I’ll continue to use these lessons that I learn in this class in future projects, ensuring that my work is functional and maintainable.
