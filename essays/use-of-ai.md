# Introduction
Artificial intelligence, also known as AI, has been used in education to help students with solving problems and giving feedback. 
In the field of Software engineering, AI has assisted software developers with generating code, debugging, documenting, and even 
software designing, making it a helpful tool for software developers. Throughout ICS314, I have been taking advantage of AI to 
improve my understanding of a complex concept,  outlining what my code needs, and troubleshooting my errors. 

# Personal Experience with AI
Experience WODs 
I didn’t use AI because there was usually a video at the end that provided a clear explanation. However, there were some cases where the video was outdated, the professor was using some other platform to code, or the syntax was different, so I would have to use AI to have that explained to me. For example, during the functional programmer WODs, the professor used syntax that I didn’t understand. In these cases, I would ask ChatGPT by copying the code and explaining it to me. Even though it took a lot of time with trial and error, I still completed the WOD with the help of AI. 

In-class Practice WODs
I choose not to use AI since the in-class practice WODs were very similar to the experience WODs, and I wanted to reinforce my understanding. 
In-class WODs
I used AI when some of the WODs were confusing and the instructions were unclear to me. For example, in the Next.js WODs, I was having trouble running some of the commands, such as npm prisma db seed. Unfortunately, the use of AI didn’t help solve the problem, which ended up in me getting a bad grade for the WOD.

Essays
I didn’t use AI for my essays. However, if I did, it was probably used to check for spelling errors so that my essay would be error-free.

Final project
For the Final Project, I used AI to lay out a page and give feedback or ideas to get me started. For instance, I was tasked with creating a schedule page, so I would ask ChatGPT what I would need on the schedule page and how I should start coding it. This allowed me to save time significantly, and without the use of ChatGPT, I wouldn’t know where to start.

Learning a concept/tutorial
If I didn’t understand a concept, I would ask ChatGPT to explain it to me. For example, if I didn’t understand how to utilize the Bootstrap/React components, I would ask ChatGPT how to use them with examples. Asking ChatGPT provided a clearer explanation and offered examples that I could use in my code. 

Answering a question in class or on Discord
 In class or on Discord, I never answered a question, so I didn’t use any AI. If anything, I would be the one asking the question because I have issues with something.
 
Asking or answering a smart question
Whenever I got stuck on something, I would ask AI a smart question so that I could get it quickly resolved. For example, I would tell ChatGPT what I have done already, the issue that I am getting, and copy and paste my code. However, doing this wasn’t useful because the problem wouldn’t get solved, so I would end up having to answer a question in the smart question channel, ask the TA for help, or go to office hours to get it fixed. 

Coding example 
Coding examples helped me understand how to write code better because it provided a reference. For instance, in the example given, “give an example of using underscore .pluck”. The coding example will help provide accurate code that can be used, which will help reduce the time spent searching documentation. 

Explaining code
After doing the experience WOD, if I didn’t understand something in the code, I would copy and paste the code into ChatGPT and ask it to explain the code line by line. For example, in the 

Writing code
If I didn’t know where to begin, I would ask ChatGPT to lay out the code for me. For example, if I wanted to create a landing page, I would ask ChatGPT to lay out a landing page for me. This was incredibly helpful and efficient because it saved me from typing 20-30 minutes of code. However, I would still have to adjust the code to get it where I want it to be. 

Documenting code
I didn’t focus on documenting my code because I usually understood what I wrote., Moving forward, I think I should start documenting my code because there are benefits in doing so, such as saving time debugging or relearning your code, and other people can understand it.

Quality assurance
Whenever I came across an error, I would usually copy and paste the error into ChatGPT and ask what was wrong and what I could do to fix the issue. In the example given, “What’s wrong with this code <code here>” is what I would usually ask ChatGPT. Most of the time, AI will explain what is wrong and what I could do to fix it, but there are some cases where the error doesn’t get fixed, which becomes a hassle. For ESLint, I came across no issues because I could simply fix them since the problem was usually a trailing space or a new line error.

Other uses in ICS 314 not listed
I have not used AI in other ways in ICS314 that are not listed. The main reasons are that I probably won’t learn as much if I keep using AI, and most of the time, AI isn’t that accurate.
