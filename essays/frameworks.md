## What is UI Framework?
Websites can be built just by using HTML and CSS but they can be very time-consuming and annoying to work with especially when dealing 
with the paddling or margin. This is where you can use UI frameworks such as Bootstrap 5 and many more frameworks. UI framework stands 
for user interface framework and it helps developers build amazing websites at a much faster pace than just using HTML and CSS. While 
using HTML and CSS to build a website is simple, UI frameworks it not as simple as they seem.

## Benefits of Using UI Frameworks
There are many benefits to learning how to use UI frameworks. As mentioned before, Ul frameworks help developers build websites quicker 
than just only using HTML and CSS. For instance, when we want to create a navigation bar we can use ```<nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light"></nav>``` 
to create a navigation bar. Not only it is significantly quicker and easier it typically also requires less coding. In the end, websites 
using UI Frameworks will look clean, professional, and consistent.

## Example
# <img width="250px"  src="/img/codingstandard.jpg" >
The website on the left was made with HTML and CSS and the website on the right was made with the help of Bootstrap 5. Off the start, 
you can tell the website made with Bootstrap 5, looks more professional and cleaner than the website using just HTML and CSS.

## My Experience Using Bootstrap 5
Before using a UI framework called Bootstrap 5, I knew nothing about UI frameworks or had any experience with them but I did have 
 prior experience building a website using HTML and CSS. When I was first introduced to Bootstrap 5, I had difficulty understanding 
 how the Bootstrap framework works and even now I have difficulty understanding. The Bootstrap framework is there to help developers 
 build websites quicker than just using HTML and CSS because you can ignore padding and margin but even then I have difficulty 
 understanding. For example, figuring out how to put the website logo in the center of the navigation was difficult for me because 
 instead of adding padding or margin in CSS, you could use one of the Bootstrap frameworks to make things easier but the problem is 
 that I do not know what. Although I have difficulty understanding how to use the Bootstrap framework, I would like to practice more 
 to make building websites easier.
