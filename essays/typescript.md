## Typescript
Learning a new programming language or a language in general takes time. Although having experience in other programming 
languages do help with learning a new programming language, there are many challenges you may come across in Typescript. 
For example, it took me a couple of days to fully understand what should go in the parameters and what to put for the return 
value. While the syntax and concepts are similar to other programming languages, I believe practicing more will help me get 
used to the syntax and concepts of Typescript.

From a software engineering perspective, I believe that Typescript is a good programming language because it is very similar to other programming languages which may make it easier for people with prior experience to learn Typescript. However, I can see where Typescript may be a bad programming language because it can be tricky when debugging. For example, in some programming languages, we use "==" but in Typescript we use "===" which can be annoying when trying to debug your code. Furthermore, I found it interesting to declare the name and the type in the parameters of a function and then specify a return type after the parameters. This is different from other programming languages, but I like how it helps in creating clear and understandable code.


## WODS
The term WOD stands for "Workout of the day" and I have never done a WOD before or known what a WOD is. During the WOD, we are given a prompt and we have a certain amount of time to code it. By the end of the WOD, coders must have a working code otherwise you will get no points. As someone new to Typescript, I believe that practicing regularly will help improve your skills which is why I think the WODs is very useful. 

WOD can be stressful at times when you have no idea where to start or if you do not understand the prompt. For instance, during my second WOD, I had trouble declaring what to put into the parameters. It can also feel overwhelming to be under time pressure while 
also trying to process unfamiliar concepts. Although they can be stressful, WODs serve as good practice and get us to learn how to 
be able to create code on the spot and give us an idea of whether or not we need more practice.
