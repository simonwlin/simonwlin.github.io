So. What do you think about Typescript so far? If youâ€™re a complete newbie, 
how does it compare to other programming languages that you know? If you have prior experience,
did you learn new things from this module, perhaps with respect to ES6? Do you think Typescript is 
a good or bad programming language from a software engineering perspective?

What about athletic software engineering? Did you find the practice 
WODs to be useful? What do you think about this style of learning?
Is it stressful? Is it enjoyable? Do you think it will work for you?

## Typescript
Learning a new programming lanuage or a language in general takes time. Although having experience in other programing languages does 
help with learning a new programming lanaguage, there are many challenges you may come across in Typescript. For example, 
it took me a couple days to fully understand what should go in the parameters and what to put for the return value. While the syntax 
and concepts are similar to other programming languages, I believe practicing more will help get used to the syntaxs and concepts of Typescript.

From a software engineering perspective, I believe that Typescript is a good programming language because 



## WODS
The term WOD stand for "Workout of the day" and I have never done a WOD before or done one. As someone new to Typescript,
I believe that practice the WODs are very useful for improving skills. Consistently doing the WODs 

WOD can be stressful at times where you have no idea where to start or if you do not understand the prompt. For instance, 
during my second WOD I had trouble declaring what to put into the parameters. It can also feel overwhelming to be under time 
pressure while aso trying to process unfamiliar concepts. Although they can be stressful, WODs serve as good practice 
and get us to learn how to be able to create code on the spot and gives us an idea of whether or not we need more practicing.



## In the Future
