# GamePlan
As a final project in ICS 314, students were tasked to create a web application as a group. As a group of 5 people, we created a web application called GamePlan, which allows people to reserve courts at the Warrior Recreation Center and find and join existing groups due to how packed the courts get after 5 pm. GamePlan includes nine features: 
1. Landing Page: Explore the appâ€™s features and get started
2. Sign In Page: Returning users can log in to access reservations and groups
3. Sign Up Page: New users can create an account to start booking courts
4. Basketball Game Page: See the score, or if there are any available slots for the day
5. Volleyball Game Page: See the score, or if there are any available slots for the day
6. Reservation Page: This page will allow users to pick which sport, court, day, and time they want to reserve.
7. Basketball Schedule Page: View upcoming basketball games
8. Volleyball Schedule Page: Check times for available volleyball courts
9. About Us Page: Provides information about the team behind GamePlan

We accomplished this project by dividing the work among ourselves so that we could contribute to something. Throughout this project, I was tasked with creating the reservation page where users can select a sport, court, and time slot, and designing the about us page to introduce the team. During development, some issues I came across when creating these pages are the spacing and what I need to put on these pages. However, since our group has no issues when communicating with each other, I asked for input on what I could do to fix these issues.

To conclude, this project has helped with my problem-solving skills, teamwork skills, as well as my skills in React, HTML, TypeScript, Node.js, PgAdmin, and Vercel. In the future, I plan on applying these skills and experiences that I've learn from this project and this course as a whole into other projects.
