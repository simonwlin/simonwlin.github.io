## Library Management System Project

Another project for ICS 212, where students are tasked to create a library management system as a group. As a group of six people, we divided the project into parts for each member to work on. 

The library management system has five features:

1. Add book: add a book to the system
2. Delete book: delete a book in the system
3. Search book: search for a book in the system
4. View all books: view all books in the system
5. Quit: quit the system

As a result of this project, I have significantly improved my coding skills in C++. This project has taught me that there are multiple ways of approaching a problem, and communication is important when working in a group. I hope to apply these skills when it comes to software engineering because it would be helpful. In the future, I aim to participate in more group projects to further enhance my coding skills.
