## Library Management System Project

Another project for ICS 212, where students are tasked to create a library management system as a group. The library management system includes five features:

1. Add book: add a book to the system
2. Delete book: delete a book in the system
3. Search book: search for a book in the system
4. View all books: view all books in the system
5. Quit: quit the system

Since we divided the projects into parts for each member to work on, I was tasked with doing the main function. The purpose of the main is to print the menu screen for the user to pick what they want to do and it calls each function. 

By the end of this project, I had gotten used to the concept of creating functions to call in the main rather than having one giant code in the main. This project helped me improve my organizational and coding skills while also learning how to collaborate effectively in a team setting.
