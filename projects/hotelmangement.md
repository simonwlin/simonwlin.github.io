## Hotel Management System Project

As our final project/exam for ICS 212, students were tasked to create a hotel management system as a group. As a group, we divided the project into parts for each member to work on. 

The hotel management system has seven features:

1. Manage Rooms
2. Check-In Room
3. Available Rooms
4. Search Customer
5. Check-Out Room
6. Guest Summary Report
7. Exit
