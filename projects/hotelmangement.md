## Hotel Management System Project

As our final project/exam for ICS 212, students were tasked to create a hotel management system as a group. As a group of six people, we divided the project into parts for each member to work on. 

The hotel management system has seven features:

1. Manage Rooms: add new rooms, search rooms, and delete rooms.
2. Check-In Room: check-in guests.
3. Available Rooms: displays a list of available rooms
4. Search Customer: searches the guest's information
5. Check-Out Room: check-out guests
6. Guest Summary Report: generates a summary of guests that are checked in. 
7. Exit: exits the system

As a result of this project, I have significantly improved my coding skills in C++. This project has taught me that there are multiple ways of approaching a problem, and communication is important when working in a group. I hope to apply these skills when it comes to software engineering because it would be helpful. In the future, I aim to participate in more group projects to further enhance my coding skills.
